# 2. Through Custom Image

Custom notebook images are a powerful tool when working with containerized environments, especially in scenarios where you need specific libraries, OS packages, or applications that are not readily available in base images. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a custom notebook image with Database Management System (DBMS) clients using Dockerfile.

## Prerequisites  

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the Open Data Hub notebooks repository:

```git clone git@github.com:opendatahub-io/notebooks.git```

**Step 2: Create a New Dockerfile**

Navigate to the codeserver folder and create a new folder for your custom image. For example, let's name it ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients. Inside this folder, create a Dockerfile with the following instructions:
 
```
# The base image auto assigned by the make recipe from the next step, in this case is the code-server notebook.
ARG BASE_IMAGE
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

WORKDIR /opt/app-root/bin

# Install OS packages as root
USER root

# Install necessary OS packages
RUN dnf install -y unixODBC postgresql

# Install MongoDB Client
COPY mongodb-org-6.0.repo-x86_64 /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-6.0.repo

RUN dnf install -y mongocli

# Install MSSQL Client
COPY mssql-2022.repo-x86_64 /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-2022.repo

RUN ACCEPT_EULA=Y dnf install -y mssql-tools18 unixODBC-devel

ENV PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools18/bin"

# Switch back to default user
USER 1001

WORKDIR /opt/app-root/src
```
  
**Step 3: Add RPM Files**

Create two RPM files, mongodb-org-6.0.repo-x86_64 and mssql-2022.repo-x86_64, in the folder you created earlier. The content for these files is provided in the tutorial.  
  
Filename: mongodb-org-6.0.repo-x86_64

```
[mongodb-org-6.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/9/mongodb-org/6.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc  
```
  
Filename: mssql-2022.repo-x86_64

```
[packages-microsoft-com-prod]
name=packages-microsoft-com-prod
baseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/9.0/prod/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
```
  
**Step 4: Build and Push the Image**

To streamline the build and push process, update the Makefile with a new recipe:

```
.PHONY: codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients
codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients: codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9
$(call image,$@,codeserver/ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients,$<)
```
  
Run the following command to build and push the image:

```
$ make codeserver-ubi9-python-3.9-db-clients -e IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/${YOUR_USERNAME}/workbench-images
```
 
Note: Replace `${YOUR_USERNAME}` with your actual username, and the registry can be any valid registry, not just quay.io.

**Step 5: Import Custom Image into ODH/RHOAI**

After pushing the custom image, import it into Red Hat OpenAI through the admin panel:

Navigate to `Settings -> Notebooks Image Settings -> Import New Image`.

**Step 6: Use Custom Image in a Data Science Project**

Create or open a Data Science Project, create a new workbench, and select the custom image from the Image Selection dropdown.

**Step 7: Verify Database Clients Installation**

Open a new terminal inside the code server and run the following command to ensure successful installation of database clients:

`$ yum list installed | grep -E 'mssql|mongo|postgresql'`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a list of installed packages related to MongoDB, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL.
