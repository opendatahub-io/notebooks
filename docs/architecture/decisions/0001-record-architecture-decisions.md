# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-01-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

We will presently ignore the [opendatahub-io/architecture-decision-records](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/architecture-decision-records)
repository, since our ADRs are (at least initially) be internal to the notebooks project itself and also because
previous experience ([PR#91](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/architecture-decision-records/pull/91))
shows that it is challenging to get merge approval for a PR there.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
